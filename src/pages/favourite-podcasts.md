I have an hour commute to and from work each day, which results in plenty of idle time. Podcasts have provided a useful tool in occupying that time. Here is a list of podcasts that I have enjoyed listening to.

# [Reply All](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/episodes)
Reply All is a podcast by Gimlet Media. Hosted by Pj Vogt and Alex Goldman since 2014 they have covered stories about the interaction between the internet and people. I have been a long time fan of this podcast and will eagerly wait for new episodes to come out each week. A few notable episodes have been [30-50 Feral Hogs](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/n8hw3d/149-3050-feral-hogs), [](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/emh82l/120-invcel) and [Voyage Into Pizzagate](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/emhwl5/83-voyage-into-pizzagate)
