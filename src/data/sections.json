Working for a small digital agency I design new digital products and try to improve the user experience of existing products. I teach Web Design and User Experience as part of the Bachelor of Arts (Content Creation) and am also undertaking postgraduate studies of Graduate Certificate in Internet Communications. I believe designers should be considered more than creators of pretty pictures."
